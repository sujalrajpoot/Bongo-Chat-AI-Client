## üìù Description

A Python client implementation demonstrating object-oriented programming principles and professional software development practices through an AI service client. This project showcases:

- Modern Python features and type hints
- Object-oriented design patterns
- Error handling and input validation
- Clean code architecture
- Professional documentation standards

## üîß Requirements

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Required packages:
  - cloudscraper
  - typing
  - dataclasses

## üì¶ Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/sujalrajpoot/Bongo-Chat-AI-Client.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd Bongo-Chat-AI-Client

# Install dependencies
pip install cloudscraper
```

## üöÄ Usage

```python
from bongo_chat import BongoChatAI, AIServiceError

def main():
    try:
        # Initialize the client
        ai_client = BongoChatAI()
        
        # Generate a response
        response = ai_client.generate_response("Hello")
        
        # Print the response
        print(f"AI Response: {response.content}")
        
    except AIServiceError as e:
        print(f"Error occurred: {str(e)}")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

## üîç Features

- Robust error handling with custom exceptions
- Type hints for better code maintainability
- Abstract base classes for extensibility
- Input validation and sanitization
- Comprehensive documentation
- Clean and maintainable code structure

## üõ†Ô∏è Error Handling

The client implements several custom exceptions for better error handling:

- `AIServiceError`: Base exception class
- `InvalidPromptError`: Raised when the prompt is invalid
- `ServiceConnectionError`: Raised when connection fails
- `CloudflareProtectionError`: Raised when bypass fails
